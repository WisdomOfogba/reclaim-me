# ReclaimMe

**ReclaimMe** is a simple web application designed to empower victims of online scams and fraud. It automates the generation of professional documents, such as police reports and emails to banks, based on a user's description of what happened. Our goal is to provide a clear path to action for individuals who often feel powerless after experiencing online fraud, especially students and average users who may not know how or what to report, or to whom.

## The Problem

Online scams and fraud are rampant, leaving many victims feeling helpless and unsure of how to proceed. The process of reporting a scam can be daunting, involving bureaucratic hurdles and a lack of clear guidance on what information is needed or how to articulate the incident effectively. This often leads to victims giving up on seeking recourse, allowing fraudsters to continue their activities unchecked.

## Our Solution

**ReclaimMe** streamlines the process of reporting online fraud. Imagine this: someone purchases shoes from a fraudulent Instagram vendor and never receives them. Instead of feeling defeated, they can open the **ReclaimMe** app, describe the incident in their own words, and receive a comprehensive package that includes:
 - A draft police report: Professionally formatted and ready to be submitted to law enforcement.
 - A complaint email to their bank: Tailored to their situation, outlining the fraudulent transaction and requesting investigation.
 - A next-steps checklist: A clear, actionable guide on what to do next to maximize their chances of recovery and justice.
**ReclaimMe** aims to demystify the reporting process, providing victims with the tools and information they need to take effective action and reclaim what's rightfully theirs.

## How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

**ReclaimMe** uses **natural language processing** (NLP) to understand the user's input and extract key details of the scam. This information is then used to populate predefined templates for various documents, ensuring accuracy and professionalism. The app also provides guidance on relevant authorities and procedures based on the type of scam reported.

We believe **ReclaimMe** can make a significant difference in helping individuals fight back against online fraud.
